# Introduction
This is a template repository for a flexible design platform around Angular 9; it makes no opinions or assumptions around project
structure outside of what is required for Angular CLI.

## Key Features
- [x] [TailwindCSS Support](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [x] SCSS Support w/PostCSS
- [x] [FontAwesome Support](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [x] [Angular CLI support](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [x] Angular HMR support
- [x] Angular AOT optimized builds
- [x] [PurgeCSS support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/purgecss)
- [x] [Lottie support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-lottie)
- [x] [Firebase support w/Angular Fire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire)

The above features should allow for ~2MB bundles for small applications while remaining designer friendly.

# Usage
To begin; using your favorite text-editor's find-all change all occurrences of `ng-tailwind-boilerplate` to your own projects name

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
